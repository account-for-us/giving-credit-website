                <strong>Giving Credit</strong> is a web-based social credit network that amplifies community finance by bringing transparency to social credit networks, protecting peer lenders against loan loss through loan guarantees, reporting informal loan repayment to credit bureaus, and enabling lenders to deduct loan loss from income taxes.

                Giving Credit was founded and built by <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/davidihenderson/">David Henderson</a> at Princeton University where he was a <a href="https://behavioralpolicy.princeton.edu/news/inaugural-sugarman-fellows-join-center">Sugarman Practitioner in Residence</a>. Like many of us, David is grateful to have been invested in by his community. There have also been times when David has been the bank ("Banco David" to his Panamanian-born mother), making informal loans to friends, family, neighbors, and co-workers.

        David is joined by Giving Credit’s co-founder, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/ashley-sherwin-875b414/">Ashley Sherwin</a>, who has spent her career in the nonprofit sector focused on wealth inequality and scaling innovative solutions that center people and communities.

        Together, we do this work to recognize and capitalize communities. We believe people should not have to choose between caring for their communities and securing their financial futures. Ultimately, we are building Giving Credit for communities like David’s, for his mother, for his late wife's family who immigrated to the United States from Mexico, and the millions more like them.
